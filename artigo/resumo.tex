This paper presents a summary, which aims to cover the main ideas available on the
literature of the past few years regarding network intrusion detection. The goal is to
explain the general architecture of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and how
different machine learning algorithms are applied. The focus of this review will be the
anomaly-based systems, which present a vast field of study.

\noindent \textbf{Palavras-chave}: nids, network security, intrusion detection, machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition
